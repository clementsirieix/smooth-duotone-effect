# Smooth Duotone Effect
## Description
I wanted to try a smooth use of the duotone effect for a project of mine.
I've tried to keep it very simple, only using svg filters.
## Usage
You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
